# ServernDB
Sprint 1: GitHub repository was created

Main purpose of the project: To learn about database creation while applying Java programming and its APIs, such as the Google Scholar API.

Key functionalities (in futures sprints):
  - Use the Java programming language.
  - Use Google Scholar API supported by SerpAPI.
  - Connect the code with a relational database (MySQL).
  - Insert specific data to be stored in the database.

Project relevance:
  - Crucial: To learn about relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
  - Intermediate: To apply previous knowledge about Java programming and GitHub version control.
  - To the future: To start reading about Spring and SpringBoot for the future challenge.
